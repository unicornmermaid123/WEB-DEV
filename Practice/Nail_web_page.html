            <p>Hello!, My name is isabella and I enojoy doing nails as a hobby! I am 15 years old and i started at a very young age but not doing nails, I was in to crafts i loved using glue, colors and glitter. I made mini box houses for my barbie dolls i got  As in my art classes to say the least i was a very creative child and I still belive i am today! I started in the year 2023 when i was in 7th grade I would always see my mom doing her nails so i started aswell by no means I was good to be honest i was horrible! my lines were sloppy I would cut my cuticules so badly to the point where it was bleeding and it hurt so bad so i would paint over them to cover it and it was just horrible, and so sadly i gave up and just moved on and threw away all my old nail stuff. Then this year in the summer as a teenager does i was just scrolling on TikTok when i came across several videos of nails and day in the life of a nail tech and I saved them since i thought is was cool but then i moved on but they kept showing up and then i just started doing research and i went on amazon and spent all of my saved money on nail supplies.<br>

            <h4>then i got started!</h4>Once they got there i got straight to work and my first set was a summer seashell set in blue and when I went to work so many people would complement me on them, and even my friends asked me to do their nail and thats when i got the idea that i could to friends and familys nails as a small "buissness" idea so i got started. </p>

    <h1>Nails!</h1>
    <h2>By Isabella German</h2>
    <h3>I will be talking about my passion for doing nails!</h3>

    <p>
      Hello! My name is Isabella and I enjoy doing nails as a hobby! I am 15 years old and I started being creative at a very young age. I loved crafts, using glue, colors, and glitter. I made mini box houses for my Barbie dolls and always got A’s in my art classes. To say the least, I was a very creative child — and I still believe I am today!
    </p>

    <p>
      I first started doing nails in 2023 when I was in 7th grade. I would always see my mom doing her nails, so I started as well. To be honest, I wasn’t very good at first! My lines were messy, and I would cut my cuticles so badly that they bled. I would even paint over them to cover it up! Eventually, I got frustrated and gave up, throwing away all my old nail stuff.
    </p>

    <h4>Then I Got Started Again!</h4>

    <p>
      This year, during the summer, I was scrolling on TikTok (like any teen does!) and started seeing lots of videos about nails and nail techs. I thought they were so cool that I began saving them. After seeing more and more videos, I finally did some research and spent my saved money on nail supplies from Amazon. When they arrived, I got straight to work! My first nail set was a summer seashell design in blue. When I went to work, so many people complimented them, and my friends even asked me to do their nails!
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s when I had an idea — I could start doing nails for friends and family as a small business! It’s something I truly enjoy, and it lets me show my creativity. One day, I hope to become a real nail tech and maybe even have my own salon.
    </p>

    <h4>Why I Love Doing Nails</h4>
    <p>
      Doing nails helps me relax and express myself. It’s like painting, but on tiny canvases! I love experimenting with colors, patterns, and designs.I feel proud of how much I’ve improved since I first started.
