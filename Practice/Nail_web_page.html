            <p>Hello!, My name is isabella and I enojoy doing nails as a hobby! I am 15 years old and i started at a very young age but not doing nails, I was in to crafts i loved using glue, colors and glitter. I made mini box houses for my barbie dolls i got  As in my art classes to say the least i was a very creative child and I still belive i am today! I started in the year 2023 when i was in 7th grade I would always see my mom doing her nails so i started aswell by no means I was good to be honest i was horrible! my lines were sloppy I would cut my cuticules so badly to the point where it was bleeding and it hurt so bad so i would paint over them to cover it and it was just horrible, and so sadly i gave up and just moved on and threw away all my old nail stuff. Then this year in the summer as a teenager does i was just scrolling on TikTok when i came across several videos of nails and day in the life of a nail tech and I saved them since i thought is was cool but then i moved on but they kept showing up and then i just started doing research and i went on amazon and spent all of my saved money on nail supplies.<br>

            <h3>Then I got started!</h3>Once they got there i got straight to work and my first set was a summer seashell set in blue and when I went to work so many people would complement me on them, and even my friends asked me to do their nail and thats when i got the idea that i could to friends and familys nails as a small "buissness" idea so i got started.
